Heat Treatment is a group of industrial, thermal and metal working processes used to change the physical, Chemical properties of a material. Heat treatment involves the use of heating or cooling, normally to extreme temperatures, to achieve the desired result such as hardening or softening of a material. 
Weâ€™ve used Aluminium-6061 sample. Aluminium 6061 is a precipitation hardening alloy that Contains Magnesium and Silicon, along with copper and Chromium in small amounts. 
This is typically used in heavy duty structures. It has high-to-moderate strength, excellent corrosion resistance, and superior machinability and weldability.
